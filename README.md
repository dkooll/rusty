Rusty is a simple, terminal-based timer application written in Rust that reminds programmers to take regular breaks.

It offers customizable break intervals and runs unobtrusively in the background, helping developers maintain a healthy work rhythm.

With Rusty, you can easily increase or decrease break frequency on the fly, ensuring you strike the right balance between productivity and rest.

Remember, even the most efficient algorithms need a pause now and then let Rusty help you optimize your coding sessions!
